				<p>I want players to confront the choices they make, and recognise their consequences for other people. I want them to think about the effects of their choices for NPCs as though they were subjects whoolly deserving of care and consideration, rather than little levers that can be stomped on to get rings or magic fruit.</p>
				
				<p>I don't like it that so many games systems encourage characters to behave like abusive sociopaths, intimidating and manipulating characters and then disappearing scot-free into the next scenario</p></div>

			<div class="general-body-text">
				<p>At other times, though, the PCs may feel that they have hit a dead end, and need to 'shake things up', or that the circumstances dictate desperate measures. In these situations, once the honest back and forth of roleplaying has been exhausted, and polite offers of cash and reciprocal aid have been turned down, the PCs may choose to push an NPC past the point where social decorum and human consideration would leave off. Such recourse to threats and coercion is dealt with in two levels, called Pushing and Shoving.</p>

				<p>This system, which models in a small way the social and emotional toll of coercion and manipulation, is a core aspect of A Traveler's Way's world. It is designed to ensure that whenever PCs place increasing pressure on others, stakes escalate and consequences multiply. It encourages PCs to be careful and conscientious enquirers, exhausting peaceful means of gathering information and negotiating and carefully weighing the effect of their actions on others.</p>

				<p>Pushing occurs when PCs decide to push an NPC's boundaries and apply socially unacceptable pressure to them. They may declare at a certain point in a conversation that they are starting to Push, or the Storyteller may declare that a particular roleplaying action, such as threatening the NPC's employment status, constitutes an escalation to this level. When this occurs, characters continue to narrate and roleplay their actions, and must describe the strategies that they are using to manipulate the NPCs. The Storyteller continues to roleplay and describe the NPCs responses. In general, Pushing signifies committing acts that will cause emotional pain, embarrassment or suffering to the NPC, to the extent that the NPC will bear lasting hurts from the interactions and remember the PC as a manipulative or abusive person. Taking the interaction beyond this point is called Shoving, and it signifies that the character has committed acts of verbal, emotional or physical violence to the NPC which are far enough beyond the pale as to cause them to be thought of as a dangerous and undesirable character by any right-thinking person who heard the NPC's story.</p>

				<p>The cost of these actions is that the PCs will lose all the future benefits of an NPCs good opinion once they choose to Push them, and become the subject of wider social censure, legal action and vigilante revenge where they Shove them. A character that Pushes several NPCs who are known to one another will soon find those characters' shared social world is closed to them. The more NPCs there are who have a poor opinion of the PCs, the more rapidly that information will spread, and the more powerful the people who will find themselves moved to act upon it. In A Traveler's Way, reputation is a resource which is keenly missed when characters have used it up.</p>

				<p>The benefit of these actions is that Pushing and Shoving each allow characters to take an opposed test of their Heart trait against the NPC they are seeking to overawe of dominate. Each level of pressure also adds a bonus die to the PC's roll, signifying the chilling effects of their manipulative or intimidatory behaviour. As such, a PC with Heart Rank of 3, who is Pushing, would roll 4d6; 3d6 for their Heart Ranks and an additional d6 for one level of pressure. If they were pushing an NPC with Heart of 2, that NPC would roll 2d6 in response. If the PC succeeds in their roll, they will always have two options, which differ with whether they have Pushed or Shoved.</p>

				<p>Where the character has Pushed and then wins their opposed test, they can ask a question which the NPC must answer strictly truthfully, or they may ask the NPC to carry out a simple, immediate action, such as unlocking a door or handing over a low-value object, which does not place them in peril. Where the character has Shoved, and succeeded in their opposed test, they can ask a question which the NPC must answer fully and openly, even where it is against their interests, or carry out a complicated or dangerous action, even where it places them in danger.</p>

				<p>These immediate benefits must be weighed against their very real costs. A person who the PCs have pushed or shoved will fear and hate them, and do almost anything in their power to thwart them. It is a means of making lasting enemies for short-term benefit.</p>

				<p>Players must also recognise that they do not know the NPC's Heart Rank when they are undertaking these tests, and that even NPCs who appear unsubtle or foolish may be exceptionally crafty people, and skilled liars or dissemblers. Further, where the character fails in these opposed tests, they receive no benefit from their gambit but they still bear the social costs of their failed attempt at domination.</p>

				<p>Additionally, and worst of all, if a character's roll for the opposed test is more than three times the NPC's, they have Blown Out, meaning that there are immediate and unpredictable consequences to their actions, more severe where NPCs have been Shoved than when they have been Pushed. For instance, A Blow Out when Pushing a squirrelly old clerk, by threatening to falsely accuse him of forgery, might see the clerk lose their normally mild mien and call indignantly for their neighbours to throw out the impudent NPCs, where success would have seen them meekly hand over a copy of a private contract. A Blow Out when Shoving a ship's captain, by claiming that the NPCs have the power to see their child stolen away from school into servitude, might lead the captain to attack the PCs with a pistol and then have their crew throw the PCs into the sea.</p>
